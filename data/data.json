He says he chose Long Beach because it was less expensive.</p>\n<p>“Financials were definitely part of my choice,” the 19-year-old said. “Growing up low-income, it was always a question of whether I was going to be able to afford university and the cost of education.”</p>\n<p>The cost of attending college is an issue many young people struggle with throughout the state. </p>\n<p>At the University of California, the average tuition costs $14,000 a year, with another $1,200 for books and supplies. California state schools, average around $5,750 in tuition, plus mandatory fees, and another $2,000 for books. California community colleges — while now free for first-time, full-time students — costs $46 per unit for part-time students.</p>\n<p>Tuition costs weigh into students’ choice in colleges, including whether they can commute from home to save money or move away to suffer the higher costs of housing. Because financial aid rarely covers living expenses, many students also have to choose between taking on debt or working to attend their dream schools. For some, it’s paying tuition or rent. </p>\n<p>While Ortiz chose CSU Long Beach because it was cheaper, he still had to take out loans and participate in work-study to pay for books, materials, and other living expenses. After changing his mind about being a computer science major a year in, Ortiz transferred to East LA Community College so he didn’t take on additional debt. He now lives with his parents and commutes to school. </p>\n<p>Ortiz is currently working 15 hours a week on campus as a writing tutor and trying to save money. He says he still has financial aid like when he attended Cal State but doesn’t have to take out loans while still having money for books and school supplies. While he plans on transferring back to another four-year university, he worries about the cost.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want money to be the reason why I stay away from a college,” Ortiz said. “I really don’t want that to hinder me from going to school.”</p>\n<p>While financial aid can cover tuition, students often struggle to make ends meet. </p>\n<p>William Suy, 20, is a junior industrial design student at San Francisco State University, which costs about $7,250 per year. While his financial aid covers most of his tuition, he still pays nearly $400 a semester out of pocket.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for the average person to get a higher education,” he said. “After paying tuition, I don’t really have much leftover for spending money, and I just pull out loans in order to really keep up with the rent and living up here.”</p>\n<p> According to a Federal Reserve Report on the economic well-being of U.S. households, 54 percent of young adults who went to college took on debt. The class of 2018 graduated with an average student loan balance of nearly $30,000, according to Student Loan Hero, a division of Lending Tree, which helps student borrowers manage debt.</p>\n<p>Suy currently lives in a two-bedroom apartment with four other people. His share of the rent is about $840 month, not including internet or utilities. Last year, he worked at Panda Express full-time but struggled to balance work and school.     </p>\n<p>“When I was working full-time, it hindered my education,” he said, “and I didn’t perform well in school.” </p>\n<p>While he wanted to have the experience of living away from home and going to college, he now says he wishes he would have found a cheaper way to get there.</p>\n<p>“If I had to redo my college experience, I would go to (a) city college and save more money and then transfer to a four-year,” he said.</p>\n<img style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" src=\"topics/education/gettyimages-73909004-1024x1024.jpg\">\n<div style=\"font-size:0.5rem;text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;\"> (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)</div>\n\n<p>But while community colleges may be cheaper, many students struggle with the high cost of housing. In some cases, just the price of room and board can impact their decision to continue their education. </p>\n<p>A 2019 study by the Hope Center, a research and policy institute, found 19 percent of California’s 2.1 million community college students, or about 399,000 people, experienced some kind of homeless during the past year. Fifty percent of all students said they were food insecure in the last month. </p>\n<p>Eric Hubbard is the development director at Jovenes, Inc., which helps adults aged 18-25 to end their cycle of homelessness. He says while working with local community colleges to arrange tours for prospective students, counselors approached the Boyle Heights non-profit asking if they could house some of their homeless students.</p>\n<p>“Homelessness amongst college students is a really big problem,” Hubbard said. “Here in Los Angeles, about one in five students at community colleges experience homelessness. The cost of living is so expensive it makes it really hard for students to meet their basic needs, pay rent, and focus on school.”</p>\n<p>Christian Navarro, 24, is a senior studying English and education at Fresno State University. He attended College of the Sequoias (COS), a community college in Visalia for two years before transferring. He’s planning to get a dual master’s and teaching credential when he finishes his undergrad. </p>\n<p>Until this year, he managed to pay for school without loans, mainly because he works about 50 hours a week at three jobs: part-time at Starbucks and a yogurt shop, and as a photographer on the side. </p>\n<p>“I try not to let it affect my schoolwork,” he said. “I sleep about 4-5 hours a night, but sometimes it’s very tough.”</p>\n<p>Navarro says he feels fortunate he went to community college first, but he wanted to move away from his small hometown, Visalia, since high school. He says while he understands the stigma some associate with community college, he still has no regrets.</p>\n<p>“I found my inspiration to become a teacher while at COS,” he said. “Some of my best professors were there.”</p>\n<p>When tuition increased this year, Navarro had to take out his first subsidized loan and expects he’ll have to take out more to continue his education. </p>\n<p>“I want to continue with my master’s, but sometimes I think about how much this is going to cost me, and if it’s all worth it,” he said. “I try to be optimistic. I know in due time I’ll have to pay it back.</p>","slug":"cost-of-tuition-a-large-burden-for-many-students"},{"title":"The Real Cost of College in California","SEOImage":"topics/education/gettyimages-97440883-1024x1024.jpg","SEOImageDesc":"Woman on protesting","SEO":"High tuition and housing costs make finances a major consideration for any prospective college student.","format":"graphic","featureImage":"","link":"topics/education/tuition/tuition.gif","text":"","slug":"the-real-cost-of-college-in-california"}],"slug":"education"},{"title":"Housing","color":"#B437C9","featureImage":"topics/vertical_housing.jpg","topics":[{"title":"California’s Housing Crisis Is Hurting Young Teachers","SEOImage":"topics/education/gettyimages-97440883-1024x1024.jpg","SEOImageDesc":"Woman on protesting","SEO":"California has some of the highest rents in the country.

Housing has been a challenge the entire time, as she only makes about $46,000 a year before taxes. </p>\n<p>During her first year of teaching, she rented a room in a West Oakland house shared with four others. Her rent and utilities were around $800. </p>\n<p>“Yes, rent was cheap,” she said, “but it was miserably depressing living in that house.”</p>\n<p>Jetter said the house’s heating didn’t work, but using multiple space heaters would trip the breaker, so it was freezing in cold months. During a heat wave, its ubiquitous brown shag carpet developed a certain aroma. “We realized there must have been cats, because the entire house reeked like cat pee,” she said.  </p>\n<p>There were issues outside the house as well. Jetter said within a few months of moving in, one of her roommates was mugged at gunpoint. “After that, I really stopped feeling safe at home,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jetter spent about eight months “living there and tolerating it” — shelling out more than half of her paycheck on rent and her teacher’s credentials — before deciding to move back in with her parents.</p>\n<p>She felt grateful to have had that option, but said that over time, the constraints of living at home started to make her feel isolated from friends, many of whom lived across the bay in San Francisco. Once she’d saved up enough, she decided to move to the city. </p>\n<p>Jetter now shares a two-bedroom apartment with one other person in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood. She has fewer roommates and lives closer to friends, but those upgrades came with a steep price tag: Jetter’s rent has doubled from what she was paying in West Oakland to $1,500 a month. </p>\n<p>By San Francisco standards, that’s a steal — the market rate for a two-bedroom in the city is $4,550 — but her rent alone now eats up about half her paycheck. (Financial experts recommend spending a third or less of take-home pay on housing.)</p>\n<p>The move has also cut into her free time: since relocating to the city, her commute has tripled from a 15-minute walk to a 45-minute BART trip each way.</p>\n<p>In all of her time as a teacher, Jetter’s housing situation had always been defined by some sort of sacrifice — comfort, safety, or money — and she didn’t see that changing. Earlier this year, she decided to quit teaching. The 2019-2020 school year will be her last.</p>\n<p>Like others leaving education because of financial hardship in the Bay Area, Jetter will miss her students the most. “There’s nothing that compares to seeing a kid grow and change over time,” she said. </p>\n<p>But it wasn’t enough. She said she always knew the job was tough, but “it wasn’t until I became a teacher that I felt how much work I do and how little I get paid.”</p>\n<p>Stories like Jetter’s were at the heart of Oakland’s seven-day teacher strike in early 2019. The Bay Area is one of the most expensive places to live in America, and teacher salaries in Oakland are some of the region’s lowest. </p>\n<img style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" src=\"topics/education/gettyimages-97440883-1024x1024.jpg\">\n<div style=\"font-size:0.5rem;text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;\"> (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)</div>\n\n<p>According to the most recent information available from California’s Department of Education, the average teacher in the city makes $63,000 a year — though new teachers, like Jetter, make much less — and pay increases are small and incremental. As a result, the Oakland Education Association estimates that the school district loses one in five of its teachers to other professions or other cities each year. </p>\n<p>It’s an extreme example of a larger problem that’s being felt in teaching communities across California. Housing is getting more expensive statewide, most notably in urban areas, and teachers, especially new ones making starting salaries, are struggling to keep up.</p>\n<p>California isn’t the only state where being a teacher is difficult. The 2019 teacher strikes in Oakland and Los Angeles were part of a larger national movement, which kicked off with a major strike in West Virginia the year before, and also included smaller strikes and protests in Oklahoma, Kentucky, Colorado, and Arizona. In October, teachers in Chicago, the country’s third-largest district, walked out for eleven days. </p>\n<img style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" src=\"topics/education/gettyimages-97440883-1024x1024.jpg\">\n<div style=\"font-size:0.5rem;text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;\"> (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)</div>\n\n<p>Even in states without strikes, teachers are frustrated. </p>\n<p>In a recent poll by PDK International, which collects opinions about education, two-thirds of all teachers surveyed said they would strike if given the chance. Half said that they’ve seriously considered leaving the profession, citing low pay as the main reason.    </p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that about a million people left the education field in 2018, more than any other year. </p>\n<p>In California, the issue of low pay is compounded by the state’s soaring housing costs.</p>\n<p>Five of the country’s top ten most expensive rental markets are located in California. San Francisco — where the average one-bedroom apartment costs about $3,500 a month — is at the top of the list, followed by San Jose, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego, according to data compiled from the rental listing site Zumper. The average teacher salary in San Francisco is $83,000.</p>\n<p>Gabriella Landeros, a California Teachers Association (CTA) spokesperson, said many educators who teach in the state’s urban districts are forced to find housing in cheaper towns and tack on long commutes to their already full work days. </p>\n<p>She shared the story of one San Jose teacher, a single dad, who commutes an hour and a half each day. He’s considered moving, but can’t leave the Bay Area because he shares custody of his daughter. “These are the decisions our teachers make every single day,” Landeros said. </p>\n<p>Situations like this don’t just affect teachers, she added. “We know that students suffer from not having their teachers live in their communities, unable to take part in after-school activities [or] develop relationships with parents and organizations.”</p>\n<p>In an effort to help combat this issue, the CTA helps teacher unions bargain for higher pay and advocates for the development of affordable housing complexes for school district employees, which have been growing in popularity across California in recent years. </p>\n<p>Such developments have already been built in Los Angeles, Santa Clara, and San Mateo. Several other school districts, most of them in the Bay Area, have approved or are considering similar projects. A 100-plus-unit housing complex in San Francisco is expected to be completed in 2023. </p>\n<p>But these developments aren’t a perfect fix. Because most of them are funded with federal tax credits, they’re only available to people within a specific income bracket. In most cases, even new teachers at the bottom of the pay scale make too much to qualify for these apartments, even if they can’t afford market-rate housing. </p>\n<p>*\n*\nIn Los Angeles, for example, the average teacher salary is about $79,000, and a one-bedroom apartment rents for around $2,300.* *The Los Angeles Unified School District — the largest in the state — has built three affordable housing complexes for its employees since 2015. To qualify for one of the units, applicants need to make 30 to 60% of the city’s area median income. Most teachers, however, make more. </p>\n<p>In 2016, the *L.A. Times *reported that LAUSD’s teachers earned too much to be eligible for the district’s housing, and that the units were being rented instead to lower-paid employees, like cafeteria workers and teaching assistants.</p>\n<img style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" src=\"topics/education/gettyimages-97440883-1024x1024.jpg\">\n<div style=\"font-size:0.5rem;text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;\"> (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)</div>\n\n<p>Sarah Chaffin, founder of Support Teacher Housing, calls teachers in this financial limbo the “missing middle.” She said there’s an urgent need for affordable housing that allows teachers to live where they work. </p>\n<p>“A lot of young people can’t even go into teaching,” she said, adding that, meanwhile, older teachers are retiring. “We’re not producing teachers because it’s too expensive to live here. The education system is going to implode unless we solve the housing crisis.”</p>\n<p>Chaffin, who has a background in banking, was inspired to get involved with housing advocacy seven years ago, after learning that her daughter’s preschool teacher was commuting an hour and a half each way to work in Palo Alto. She started advocating for affordable housing measures that rely on traditional finance practices, rather than federal funding. She’s working on building a model that can be replicated by school districts and, eventually, other industries across the state. </p>\n<p>In October, Facebook announced plans to donate $25 million to help fund a housing development for teachers in Silicon Valley. Because it’s being financed by philanthropy, the complex’s 90 to 120 units will be available to even those teachers who earn too much to be considered for traditional subsidized housing. </p>\n<p>“It’s a game changer,” Chaffin said. “And it’s a real acknowledgement from Facebook: We have been part of the problem, but now we’re going to be part of the solution to solve the housing crisis.”</p>\n<p>The donation is one of several recent gestures by the tech industry to support education and housing affordability in California. In September, Salesforce pledged $18.2 million in grants to the San Francisco and Oakland school districts. In November, Apple announced a detailed $2.5 billion plan to address the housing crisis all across the state.</p>\n<p>The tech industry, largely centered in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area, has long been accused of exacerbating the region’s housing problems. Big tech companies have brought hundreds of thousands of new residents to the area, creating competition for housing and driving up prices. Because those same companies also offer competitive salaries, their employees are better able to keep up with the region’s high cost of living.</p>\n<p>This was one of the factors that led to Jetter’s decision to quit teaching. Watching so many of her peers get high-paying tech jobs made her feel discouraged about a future in education, considering she expects her salary to top out at around $80,000.  </p>\n<p>“Some of my friends who work in tech doing unnecessary jobs, a lot of them start [there]. They can ask for promotions or get bonuses,” she said. “You don’t get to do that as a teacher.”</p>\n<p>This difference isn’t lost on the Oakland Unified School District. John Sasaki, the district’s spokesperson, said officials know that as a public agency they can’t offer the same perks as large tech companies like Google or Facebook. </p>\n<p>“Being located so close to Silicon Valley, we are in competition with the tech industry for good talent,” he said. “Based on the money, it’s hard to win that fight in some cases.” </p>\n<p>Jetter, for one, isn’t leaving teaching to pursue a career in tech. She’s in the process of applying to law schools, where she wants to study labor law, in large part due to her experiences participating in the Oakland teacher strike. </p>\n<p>Still, many others stay in education, even when it means making sacrifices. </p>\n<p>Ali King, 29, just started teaching ethnic studies at Coliseum College Prep Academy in East Oakland with a salary of about $58,000 a year. She lives with her fiancée, who’s also a teacher, in the nearby city of Dublin. The two share a one-bedroom apartment in San Ramon, about 25 miles east of Oakland, for $2,600.</p>\n<p>King’s commute is about 40 minutes each way. In the Bay Area’s notoriously heavy traffic, it can sometimes take over an hour. </p>\n<p>“We were thinking of moving because of the commute,” she said, “but realistically, unless we get some wildly lucky Craigslist deal, it’s not financially responsible. We feel trapped.”</p>\n<p>In addition to teaching, King coaches volleyball. During the season, she leaves her house at 6:30 a.m. and doesn’t return home until nearly 8 p.m. </p>\n<p>“The hardest part is coming home so late and deciding whether I’m going to plan for tomorrow, grade work, or spend time with my fiancée,” she said. </p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties, King said she’s committed to staying in education. She loves her job, and she’s happy to be in Oakland, a district that feels more organized and progressive than others she’s worked in. </p>\n<p>Still, King sometimes wonders if her future as a teacher will always be marked by sacrifice, including not being able to buy a home or start a family in the Bay Area. </p>\n<p>“I hear it eventually gets more stable,” she said. But right now, “it feels shaky. It feels really unsustainable.”</p>","slug":"californias-housing-crisis-is-hurting-young-teachers"},{"title":"California Housing by the Numbers","SEOImage":"","SEOImageDesc":"","SEO":"","format":"graphic","featureImage":"","link":"topics/housing/graphics/the_cost_of_living_in_ca_1.png","slug":"california-housing-by-the-numbers"},{"title":"What About The Rest of The Country?","SEOImage":"","SEOImageDesc":"","SEO":"","format":"graphic","featureImage":"","link":"topics/housing/graphics/the_cost_of_living_in_ca_2.png","slug":"what-about-the-rest-of-the-country"},{"title":"The Compromise of Choosing to Live in San Francisco","SEO":"”Every time I get paid, it seems like it’s just eaten up.” Lots of people struggle to find affordable housing in San Francisco, but what’s it like for college students juggling tuition and skyrocketing rents.","SEOImage":"","SEOImageDesc":"","format":"video","featureImage":"","Text":"What’s it like to live in one of the most expensive cities in the United States — as a student?

So driving for Uber, delivering groceries for Instacart, or picking up someone’s burrito at Chipotle is becoming more common. </p>\n<p>Young people aged 16-25 make up the largest group of workers in the gig economy, about 27% percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). But what exactly everyone is doing isn’t clear, as the gig economy covers numerous jobs, from ride-hailing app drivers to substitute teachers.</p>\n<p>Gig economy workers typically live in urban areas, namely the San Francisco Bay Area, where many online platform companies were founded, federal data shows. </p>\n<p>While these jobs have skyrocketed in San Francisco, Oakland, and Los Angeles, young adults in rural communities like Merced in California’s Central Valley don’t reap the same benefits. Some can’t able to afford a car and others complain there’s just not enough demand to make a profit. </p>\n<p>Mary Dagsi, an 18-year-old Merced high school senior, says she drove for DoorDash, but it only took her a month to realize the margin of profit was insignificant. Dagsi recalls earning $50 after working six hours, which is far below California’s minimum wage of $12 an hour. </p>\n<p>“It’s so little money and people don’t really give tips,” she said. “It took a long time for orders to come through, and it’s very long hours for so little money.”</p>\n<p>Dagsi was also concerned about her safety. “It’s just delivering food, but you could be delivering food to a murderer,” she said. </p>\n<p>Safety and financial concerns are common among gig workers, but for many like Dagsi, there aren’t many options when looking for work. The latest numbers from the state’s labor department show Merced County’s unemployment rate is 6.5%, nearly double the state rate. </p>\n<p>That suggests more people are having greater difficulty finding alternative employment both in and out of the gig economy. </p>\n<p>Dr. Richard Works, Ph.D., an economist with BLS,<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2018/beyond-bls/examining-the-market-power-of-on-demand-labor-platforms-in-the-gig-economy.htm\"> writes</a> the lack of other work is one reason why the power of the gig economy lies in the hands of the companies that run them, not the people who work in it. That “disproportionate market power” also involves companies giving workers limited information about what goes on behind the scenes of their jobs and crafting platforms to benefit those companies, not the workers.</p>\n<p>“The devaluation of productivity in wages is substantial if employers are exploiting the capacity to set wages,” Works wrote.</p>\n<p>In other words, the gig economy is sold to workers as giving them the freedom to be their own bosses, but they don’t have the power to determine their own salary. </p>\n<p>Despite limited opportunities, college students like Esmeralda Nuñez are finding creative ways to earn money. At 19, she’s too young to drive for Uber or Lyft, but she’s found an alternative by meeting a need and reaping the benefits. </p>\n<p>She gives rides to her fellow UC Merced students and delivers food to them on campus. Her rates usually range from $5-8 for a one-way trip. Her pricing is based on what Uber and Lyft are charging at the time and she adjusts for the cost of gas.

But I am a survivor who can say that I’m still here, and I overcame a historically poorly addressed problem. \nAt 14, I was in a yearlong emotionally and physically abusive relationship with my first boyfriend. He would berate me constantly, insulting my physical appearance, and assaulting my confidence. He took advantage of my body, as the low self-esteem I harbored made me weep at my own reflection. He also frequently hit me. I felt powerless to defend myself, because I always blamed myself for upsetting him. \nI tried to get help. I told people what was going on, but I was met with attacks on my integrity. \nEven after leaving that toxic relationship, its repercussions affected me for years. I had physical and psychological reactions to hearing people screaming or fighting. Seeing physical violence made me ball up and cry, bringing me back to when I was abused. \nI suffered from an eating disorder for most of high school, constantly weighing myself and becoming angry every time I saw the number on the scale. There were days I wouldn’t eat at all. I’d cry myself to sleep and think about taking my own life. \nIt was only after I collapsed while running after not eating for two days that I realized I could no longer live like that. I decided that I needed to turn my life around. \nI began opening up about my experiences to my family and close friends, all of whom provided affirmation and support. It was a needed sense of relief. Knowing that I mattered helped me address my long-harbored feelings of worthlessness. It helped me slowly climb to a healthy state where I could not only finally recognize myself in the mirror, but I was able to smile back. \nUpon taking on these grueling struggles, I came to realize I wasn’t alone in battling my depression. It motivated me to make more of a positive impact on others. \nI recognize that I’m lucky enough to have a loving family and friends that support me, which is not often the case. That’s why we all must make a conjoined effort to uplift others and aid those in need. \nThat’s why I strive to increase support and resources for youth struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. \nSchools throughout the country are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to adequately help students struggling with depression. It’s hard for teachers and administrators to notice students struggling with mental health issues, as they can manifest in overt or covert ways. \nSchools need more state and federal funding to expand mental health care to provide all students with free and accessible therapy. Schools need to recognize that suicide and teen depression are major issues that require more than just raised awareness. School districts need an increase in resources and services. \nI’m now a college student, far away from Los Angeles. My experience makes school, work and being removed from my family tough. That’s why I’m involved in activities that align with my passions and culture, building connections with others like me. I prioritize going to therapy when I can, which has helped me to address and overcome my eating disorder and recover my mental stability. \nThere was a time when I didn’t think I’d make it past my adolescence, but now I’m thriving as a survivor. \nNOTE: If you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741.","slug":"thriving-as-a-survivor-how-reaching-out-saved-my-life"},{"title":"The Rates of Teenage Suicide","format":"graphic","featureImage":"","link":"","slug":"the-rates-of-teenage-suicide"}],"slug":"mental-health"}],"slug":"not-so-golden"}}
